Customer Segmentation for a Mall using Multivariate Analysis
Mall management aims to improve marketing effectiveness, enhance customer experience, and increase overall sales by better understanding the diverse characteristics of its customers. However, the current marketing strategies target customers uniformly without considering differences in purchasing behavior, spending capacity, age groups, and income levels. This results in inefficient allocation of promotional resources and missed opportunities for personalized engagement.
